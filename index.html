        <h3>Why should I use Smartcaptcha?</h3>

<p>
	There are two kind of people on your website. People who can't read your captcha, and spambots.
	This is not the way it should be. Users shouldn't be bothered by a difficult task like making something useful out of a recaptcha image,
	and spambots should be kept away from your service by a good turing test.<br /> This sounds really difficult, but it's not. It's because
	spambots aren't <strong>smart</strong>. For them carrots aren't a vegetable. Carrots is a string out of 7 characters.<br />
	By using the fact that humans are smart, this open source project made a captcha task which is impossible for bots, and almost too easy for a user.

<!--<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>-->

<h3>Really? Let me see!</h3>

<p>
	This example is without all the extra security features. Most of the time this is save enough.
</p>

<p>
	But if you really care about no spambot ever coming in again, you could use something like this.

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

   <p>
   		No it doesn't! Smartcaptcha is made by smart people just like you who really don't have the time to make something out of nothing.
   		You can just copy-paste the code below, change some things, and you're up and running!
   </p>
   <p>Create a new captcha image in your form page:</p>
   <pre>
   	<code>// Include the Simple-captcha class

require( "scaptcha/scaptcha.inc.php" );
	
ob_start();

$captcha = new SmartCaptcha();
$captcha->draw();

//	load the image from the OB into the $img var.

$img = ob_get_clean();
$secretword	=	$captcha->getCheckText();
$question				=	$captcha->getQuestion();

// Put it in the SESSION-data for later use.

$_SESSION['secretword']	=	$secretword;
	
/*
 * 
 * BASE 64 is a really easy way to use an image in the same page.
 * 
 * &#60;img src="data:image/png;base64,{ your data }" /&#62;
 * 
 */

$img	=	 base64_encode($img);</code>
   	
   </pre>
   
   
   	<p>
   		You can now just use <code>$img</code> as a base64 image file in your code and <code>$question</code> as the associated captcha question.
   	</p>
   	<pre>
   		<code>&#60;h4>&#60;?php echo $question;?&#62;&#60;/h4&#62;
&#60;img src="data:image/png;base64,&#60;?php echo $img?&#62;" alt="Captcha image" /&#62;</code>
   	</pre>
   	
   	<p>In the other page, where you want to check if the image is filled in correctly you can use the <code>$_SESSION['secretword']</code> where the correct answer is stored. <strong>It's simple as that!</strong></p>
     
     <p>Still not clear? Don't bother. If you download the archive you will find a working example with everything you need in the <code>demo/</code> directory.</p>
     
     <h3>Questions?</h3>
     
     	<h4>Which browsers do you support?</h4>
     	<p>Every important browser is supported. Only IE6 doesn't support base64-images, but there is a workaroud if you really want to support IE6.</p>

		<h4>In which lanugages is this available?</h4>
		<p>
			We have a default dataset in English and Dutch, but it's fairly easy to create one yourself. If you do so please contact me so other people
			can use it too.
